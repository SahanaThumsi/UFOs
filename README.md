# UFOs
## PURPOSE
The goal of this project is to create a webpage for Dana with a dynamic table. This webpage provides an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. 
It allows users to use  one to multiple criteria at the same time and get the required data like date city state country etc.

## SUMMARY
- A drawback in this analysis project is that the user is  not aware of The time period to use to search for the required data. We also need more people to use the website to even comment on its drawbacks.Another Draw back is that, if a wrong  search  criteria  or a  search entered which is not in the data, then a message to the user would help ,saying invalid data or error. 
- The webpage can be improved with a filter button which makes it more easier for the user an interactive.
- since some of the data is unknown for the user to input, a drop down menu for all the input boxes will help the user to easily select what they need. Example –The types of shapes drop-down menu for entering a shape, A date range or a calendar to select the dates
These minor changes will make a big difference and more user friendly.
